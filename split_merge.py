    '''Recursively split a graph via min-cuts such that the given component
    nodes are separated.

    In every iteration, the two largest components that are not split are
    selected, and a min-cut is sought between the two closest nodes of these
    two components.

    Args:

        graph (networkx-like graph):

            The graph to split.

        components (``list`` of ``list`` of nodes):

            The nodes to separate from each other.

        position_attributes (``list`` of ``string``):

            The names of the spatial position attributes of the nodes. Needed
            to find the closest split nodes.

        weight_attribute (``string``):

            The name of the edge attribute that holds the weight for the
            min-cut.

        split_attribute (``string``):

            The name of the node attribute in which to store the ID of the
            split each node ended up in.

    Returns:

        The number of splits performed.
